# Trino

In this section, we provide guides and references to use the Trino connector. You can view the full documentation for Trino [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/trino).

## Requirements
To extract metadata, the user needs to have `SELECT` permission on the following tables:
- `information_schema.schemata`
- `information_schema.columns`
- `information_schema.tables`
- `information_schema.views`
- `system.metadata.table_comments`

Access to resources will be based on the user access permission to access specific data sources. More information regarding access and security can be found in the Trino documentation [here](https://trino.io/docs/current/security.html).

### Profiler & Data Quality
Executing the profiler Workflow or data quality tests, will require the user to have `SELECT` permission on the tables/schemas where the profiler/tests will be executed. More information on the profiler workflow setup can be found [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/profiler) and data quality tests [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/ingestion/workflows/data-quality).

You can find further information on the Trino connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/trino).
