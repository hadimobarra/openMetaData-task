# AzureSQL

In this section, we provide guides and references to use the AzureSQL connector.

## Requirements

Make sure if you have whitelisted the ingestion IP on Azure SQL firewall rules. Checkout [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/firewall-configure?view=azuresql#use-the-azure-portal-to-manage-server-level-ip-firewall-rules) document on how to whitelist your IP using the Azure portal.

AzureSQL database user must grant `SELECT` privilege to fetch the metadata of tables and views.

```sql
-- Create a new user
-- More details https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-user-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16
CREATE USER Mary WITH PASSWORD = '********';
-- Grant SELECT on table
GRANT SELECT TO Mary;
```

You can find further information on the Azure connector in the [docs](https://docs.open-metadata.org/connectors/database/azuresql).

Connecting to AzureSQL requires the ODBC driver to be installed. Specify ODBC driver name in the field.

You can download the ODBC driver from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16).

In case of Docker or Kubernetes deployments, this driver comes out of the box with version `ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server`.
